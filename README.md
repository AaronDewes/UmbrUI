## UmbrUI (Umb-roo-eee)
### [Umbrel](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel) UI developed for 3.5" GPIO screens

- This is still very early stages 
- Intended to be run as part of the Umbrel App system (hence the docker-compose)

The goal is to be able to present the user with some helpful information such as: 
- IP/TOR address 
- QR Code to link to url
- Funds Status
- How many channels
- Forwards in the last 24hrs

We can go the Raspiblitz route and add some touchscreen functionality but for now I think this should focus on presenting some basic data to allow the user to get up and running.

To run localy (within X / mac):
```
NOTPI=true python3 ui.py
```

On Pi:
```
python3 ui.py
```

The googleapis submodule is only needed for the generation of some python files.
You don't need it normally while using or developing this app, except when adding a new feature that requires a newer version of LND.
If that's the case, first update the rpc.proto to the version from the latest LND, then run:
```

```

rpc.proto is available at https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/lnrpc/rpc.proto.
Please don't use the file from a later version of LND than the one currently used in Umbrel to avoid issues.
